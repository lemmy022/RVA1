                The PlayStation is a series of video game consoles created and developed by Sony Computer Entertainment
                <br>with consoles in the fifth to eighth generations. The brand was first introduced on December 3, 1994 in
                <br>Japan with the launch of the original PlayStation console.[1] It now consists of a total of four core
                <br>home consoles, as well as a media center, an online service, a line of controllers, two handhelds
                <br>and a phone, as well as multiple magazines.

                Using a PS1 emulator you can play Sony PlayStation games without actually buying
                <br> the console or the games. PS1 emulator is typically a software application
                <br>that uses the PlayStation program on a desktop or laptop which enables you to
                <br>play the games as you would have played on PlayStation 1. The only difference would
                <br>be that instead of using the joysticks and gamepads, you would be using the keyboards
                <br> and keypads to play the game.
